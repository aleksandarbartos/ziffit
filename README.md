## Project to run Smoke tests on Ziffit Web application

### Introduction

This project was created to execute smoke tests on the Ziffit Web application.
Disclaimer: the tests are executed in the production environment

### Prerequisites

NodeJS is installed on the local machine

Git is installed on the local machine

A source-code editor is installed on the local machine

### Installation and set up configuration

1. Clone the project to you local machine using

```text {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0R743944M"}
git clone

```

2. Open the cloned project folder, open a Terminal and run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0R7KG1K1G"}
npm install

```

3. After npm install a node_modules folder and a package-lock.json file should be present in the project directory
4. Make sure the testData folder files contain data and are not empty

### Executable scripts:

To install all dependencies using package.json data

```sh {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0RAMDY7EC"}
npm install

```

To install all dependencies using package-lock.json data

```sh {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0RDQ3XP57"}
npm run setup

```

To fix eslint problems

```sh {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0REJCJGJX"}
npm run eslint:fix

```

To execute the smoke tests

```sh {"id":"01HNZE79RCH4YTWPJ0RFQ2MRQG"}
npm run test

```

### Project structure

src folder contains the helpers used in the test execution (Helpers)

pages folder contains the PageObjects (Main page, Login page, Registration page, Basket)

test/specs folder contains the test files (test.e2e.smoke)

test/testData folder contains the test data used in the tests (assertion data, navigation data, barcodes)
The user related test data is generated in test runtime (firstname, lastname, email, password) using fetch (firstname, lastname) and npm packages (generate-password, random-email)

### Addig new tests to the project

Make sure you create a separate branch for the new test development

Before commiting and pushing your changes, run eslint:fix command to ensure code quality

Raise a merge request for code review

### Smoke test cases documentation

Not covered test cases in the Smoke suit as the tests run on Production environment:

- Successful login
- Successful registration

### Possibly unstable solutions

- Some selectors could not be precisely defined, as multiple elements share the same selectors, findElements method with indexing was used for these:
   - RegistrationPage.requiredErrorMessage
   - BasketPage.listItemTitle, BasketPage.listItemRemove (findElements used on purpose to enable deletion of any item in the list)
- wdio.config beforeTest hook (additional empty session before first test)
